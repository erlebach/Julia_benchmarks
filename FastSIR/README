To run in Atom: 
(I am not using Revise.jl)

Starting in FastSIR_main.jl: 

Execute entire file. 

Hierarchy is flat, all files in the same directory. 
Files: 

FastSIR_common.jl: common methods across FastSIR implementations
FastSIR_graphs.jl: list of include statements
FastSIR_no_nodes_impl.jl: FastSIR with the Node Datastructure. 
     Contained in module FastSIRNoNodes. 
FastSIR_with_nodes_impl.jl: FastSIR with node structure replaced by collection of arrays
     Contained in module FastSIRWithNodes. 
FastSir_main.jl: includes FastSIR_graphs.jl, sets up the Graph and runs two simulations

Notes: 
I was expecting the array-based implementation to have far less allocations, but that was not 
the case.
